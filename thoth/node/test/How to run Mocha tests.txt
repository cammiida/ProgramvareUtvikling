How to run node.js tests:


1. You need to have Mocha, Chai, socket installed (perhaps some other moduels as well). Install these by entering the node folder and write 
	- npm install mocha
	- npm install chai
	- npm install socket.io

ps! You can not have a open browser with the thoth webpage open. This could interfere with the tests. If a teacher or student is connected to the server we are testing some of the assertions would be wrong. 
	
2. open a shell or some form of terminal. Run this command:
	mocha test
It should now run the test and you should see the different tests with a check mark next to it. There will be some other text as well. This text is the console.log text which is there to ensure everything is happening correctly.
