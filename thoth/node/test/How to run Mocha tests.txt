How to run node.js tests:

1. You need to have Mocha, Chai, socket installed (perhaps some other moduels as well). Install these by entering the node folder and write 
	- npm install mocha
	- npm install chai
	- npm install socket.io

2. You have to have the node server running. Open up a terminal and start the node server with: 
	node server.js
	
3. open a shell or some form of terminal. Run this command:
	mocha test
It should now run the test and you should see the different tests with a check mark next to it.
